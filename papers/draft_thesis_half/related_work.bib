  abstract = {Gene expression programming, a genotype/phenotype genetic algorithm (linearand ramified), is presented here for the first time as a new technique for thecreation of computer programs. Gene expression programming uses characterlinear chromosomes composed of genes structurally organized in a head and atail. The chromosomes function as a genome and are subjected to modification bymeans of mutation, transposition, root transposition, gene transposition, generecombination, and one- and two-point recombination. The chromosomes encodeexpression trees which are the object of selection. The creation of theseseparate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct functions allowsthe algorithm to perform with high efficiency that greatly surpasses existingadaptive techniques. The suite of problems chosen to illustrate the power andversatility of gene expression programming includes symbolic regression,sequence induction with and without constant creation, block stacking, cellularautomata rules for the density-classification problem, and two problems ofboolean concept learning: the 11-multiplexer and the GP rule problem.},

  abstract = {Gene expression programming (GEP) uses mutation,
                 transposition, and crossover to create variation.
                 Although there exists a large body of work in genetic
                 algorithms concerning the roles of mutation and
                 recombination, these results not only do not apply to
                 GEP due to the genotype/phenotype representation but
                 also seem to contradict the GEP experience. Therefore,
                 and given the diversity of GEP operators, it is
                 convenient to develop some kind of understanding of
                 their power. The aim of this work is to help develop
                 such an understanding and to show the evolutionary
                 dynamics and the transforming power of each genetic
                 operator, with their advantages and limitations.},

                 combinatorial-specific search operators so that
                 populations of candidate solutions can evolve
                 efficiently. Indeed, several researchers created
                 modifications to the basic genetic operators of
                 mutation and recombination in order to create high
                 performing combinatorial-specific operators. However,
                 it is not known which operators perform better as no
                 systematic comparisons have been done. In this work, a
                 new algorithm that explores a new chromosomal
                 organisation based on multigene families is used. This
                 new organization together with several
                 combinatorial-specific search operators, namely,
                 inversion, gene and sequence deletion/insertion, and
                 restricted and generalised permutation, allow the
                 algorithm to perform with high efficiency. The
                 performance of the new algorithm is empirically
                 compared on the 13- and 19-cities tour travelling
                 salesperson problem, showing that the long abandoned
                 inversion operator is by far the most efficient of the
                 combinatorial operators. The efficiency and
                 potentialities of the new algorithm are further

                 sizes and shapes (the phenotype) encoded in linear
                 chromosomes of fixed length (the geno-type). The
                 chromosomes are composed of multiple genes, each gene
                 encoding a smaller sub-program. Furthermore, the
                 structural and functional organization of the linear

                 function finding problems, including a high dimensional

                 to discuss the question of constant creation in

                 the numerical constants on its own or invents new ways

                 that evolutionary algorithms perform considerably worse

                 genotype (chromosomes) and phenotype (expression trees)
                 is made possible by the structural and functional
                 organisation of the linear chromosomes. This
                 organization allows the unconstrained operation of
                 important genetic operators such as mutation,

                 the initial diversity in evolving populations of

  abstract = {In this chapter an artificial problem solver inspired
                 in natural genotype/phenotype systems gene expression
                 programming is presented. As an introduction, the
                 fundamental differences between gene expression
                 programming and its predecessors, genetic algorithms
                 and genetic programming, are briefly summarised so that
                 the evolutionary advantages of gene expression
                 programming are better understood. The work proceeds
                 with a detailed description of the architecture of the
                 main players of this new algorithm (chromosomes and
                 expression trees), focusing mainly on the interactions
                 between them and how the simple yet revolutionary
                 structure of the chromosomes allows the efficient,
                 unconstrained exploration of the search space. And
                 finally, the chapter closes with an advanced
                 application in which gene expression programming is
                 used to evolve computer programs for diagnosing breast

  abstract = {An artificial neural network with all its elements is
                 a rather complex structure, not easily constructed
                 and/or trained to perform a particular task.
                 Consequently, several researchers used Genetic
                 Algorithms to evolve partial aspects of neural
                 networks, such as the weights, the thresholds, and the
                 network architecture. Indeed, over the last decade many
                 systems have been developed that perform total network
                 induction. In this work it is shown how the chromosomes
                 of Gene Expression Programming can be modified so that
                 a complete neural network, including the architecture,
                 the weights and thresholds, could be totally encoded in
                 a linear chromosome. It is also shown how this
                 chromosomal organization allows the training/adaptation
                 of the network using the evolutionary mechanisms of
                 selection and modification, thus providing an approach
                 to the automatic design of neural networks. The
                 workings and performance of this new algorithm are
                 tested on the 6-multiplexer and on the classical
                 exclusive-or problems.},

  abstract = {Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is a new technique
                 of Genetic Programming (GP) that implements a linear
                 genotype representation. It uses fixed-length
                 chromosomes to represent expression trees of different
                 shapes and sizes, which results in unconstrained search
                 of the genome space while still ensuring validity of
                 the programs output. However, GEP has some difficulty
                 in discovering suitable function structures because the
                 genetic operators are more disruptive than traditional
                 tree-based GP. One possible remedy is to specifically
                 assist the algorithm in discovering useful numeric
                 constants. In this paper, the effectiveness of several
                 constant creation techniques for GEP has been
                 investigated through two symbolic regression benchmark
                 problems. Our experimental results show that constant
                 creation methods applied to the whole population for
                 selected generations perform better than methods that
                 are applied only to the best individuals. The proposed
                 tune-up process for the entire population can
                 significantly improve the average fitness of the best
                 solutions.},

                 specially suited to deal with symbolic regression
                 problems. Amongst the new features implemented in
                 EGIPSYS are: new selection methods, chromosomes of
                 variable length, a new approach to manipulating
                 constants, new genetic operators and an adaptable
                 fitness function. All the proposed improvements were
                 tested separately, and proved to be advantageous over
                 the basic GEP. EGIPSYS was also applied to four
                 difficult identification problems and its performance
                 was compared with a traditional implementation of
                 genetic programming (LilGP). Overall, EGIPSYS was able
                 to obtain consistently better results than the system
                 using genetic programming, finding less complex
                 solutions with less computational effort. The success

                 pavement's structural condition non-destructively. It
                 is essential not only to evaluate the structural
                 integrity of an existing pavement but also to have
                 accurate information on pavement surface condition in
                 order to establish a reasonable pavement rehabilitation
                 design system. Pavement layers are characterised by
                 their elastic moduli estimated from surface deflections
                 through back calculation. Backcalculating the pavement
                 layer moduli is a well-accepted procedure for the
                 evaluation of the structural capacity of pavements. The
                 ultimate aim of the back calculation process from
                 non-destructive testing (NDT) results is to estimate
                 the pavement material properties. Using backcalculation
                 analysis, flexible pavement layer thicknesses together
                 with in-situ material properties can be back calculated
                 from the measured field data through appropriate
                 analysis techniques. In this study, artificial neural
                 networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP)
                 are used in back calculating the pavement layer

                 layer moduli are well-accepted procedures for the
                 evaluation of the structural capacity of pavements. The
                 ultimate aim of the backcalculation process from

                 pavement material properties. Using back calculation

                 calculated from the measured field data through
                 appropriate analysis techniques. In order to back
                 calculate reliable moduli, deflection basin must be

                 evolutionary method derived from Genetic Programming
                 (GP) for model learning and knowledge discovery.
                 However, when dealing with complex problems, its
                 genotype under Karva notation does not allow
                 hierarchical composition of the solution, which impairs
                 the efficiency of the algorithm. We propose a new
                 representation scheme based on prefix notation that
                 overcomes the original GEP's drawbacks. The resulted
                 algorithm is called Prefix GEP (P-GEP). The major
                 advantages with P-GEP include the natural hierarchy in
                 forming the solutions and more protective genetic
                 operations for substructure components. An artificial
                 symbolic regression problem and a set of benchmark
                 classification problems from UCI machine learning
                 repository have been tested to demonstrate the
                 applicability of P-GEP. The results show that P-GEP
                 follows a faster fitness convergence curve and the
                 rules generated from P-GEP consistently achieve better
                 average classification accuracy compared with GEP},

  abstract = {Linear genotype representation and modularity have
                 continuously received extensive attention from the
                 Genetic Programming (GP) community. The advantages of a
                 linear genotype include a convenient and efficient
                 implementation scheme. However, most existing
                 techniques using a linear genotype follow the
                 imperative programming language paradigm and a direct
                 hierarchical composition for the functionality of the
                 solution is under achieved. Our work is based on Prefix
                 Gene Expression Programming (P-GEP), a new GP method
                 featured by a prefix notation based linear genotype
                 representation. Since P-GEP uses a functional language
                 paradigm, its framework results in natural self
                 emergence of substructures as functional components
                 during the evolution. We propose to preserve and use
                 potentially useful emergent substructures via a dynamic
                 substructure library, empowering the algorithm to focus
                 the search on a higher level of the solution structure.
                 Preliminary experiments on the benchmark regression
                 problems have shown the effectiveness of this

                 injures thousands each year. Cleanup costs are

                 discriminating buried UXO from other inert non-UXO
                 objects. Government agencies are actively searching for
                 improved sensor methodologies to detect and
                 discriminate buried UXO from other objects. We describe
                 the results of work performed on data gathered by the

                 In this chapter it is shown how Automatically Defined
                 Functions are encoded in the genotype/phenotype system
                 of Gene Expression Programming. As an introduction, the
                 fundamental differences between Gene Expression
                 Programming and its predecessors, Genetic Algorithms
                 and Genetic Programming, are briefly summarized so that
                 the evolutionary advantages of Gene Expression
                 Programming are better understood. The introduction
                 proceeds with a detailed description of the
                 architecture of the main players of Gene Expression
                 Programming (chromosomes and expression trees),
                 focusing mainly on the interactions between them and
                 how the simple, yet revolutionary, structure of the
                 chromosomes allows the efficient, unconstrained
                 exploration of the search space. The work proceeds with
                 an introduction to Automatically Defined Functions and
                 how they are implemented in Gene Expression
                 Programming. Furthermore, the importance of
                 Automatically Defined Functions in Evolutionary
                 Computation is thoroughly analyzed by comparing the
                 performance of sophisticated learning systems with
                 Automatically Defined Functions with much simpler ones
                 on the sextic polynomial problem.},

  abstract = {An artificial neural network with all its elements is
                 a rather complex structure, not easily constructed
                 and/or trained to perform a particular task.
                 Consequently, several researchers used genetic
                 algorithms to evolve partial aspects of neural
                 networks, such as the weights, the thresholds, and the
                 network architecture. Indeed, over the last decade many
                 systems have been developed that perform total network
                 induction. In this work it is shown how the chromosomes
                 of Gene Expression Programming can be modified so that
                 a complete neural network, including the architecture,
                 the weights and thresholds, could be totally encoded in
                 a linear chromosome. It is also shown how this
                 chromosomal organisation allows the training/adaptation
                 of the network using the evolutionary mechanisms of
                 selection and modification, thus providing an approach
                 to the automatic design of neural networks. The
                 workings and performance of this new algorithm are
                 tested on the 6-multiplexer and on the classical
                 exclusive-or problems.},

                 Due to its encoding scheme, the system allows the
                 automatic discovery of flexible rules, better fitted to
                 data. The performance of GEPCLASS was compared with two
                 genetic programming systems and with C4.5, over four
                 data sets in a five-fold cross-validation procedure.
                 The predictive accuracy for the methods compared were
                 similar, but the computational effort needed by
                 GEPCLASS was significantly smaller than the other.
                 GEPCLASS was able to find simple and accurate rules as
                 it can handle continuous and categorical attributes.},

  abstract = {Gene Expression Programming (GEP) aims at discovering
                 essential rules hidden in observed data and expressing
                 them mathematically. GEP has been proved to be a
                 powerful tool for constructing efficient classifiers.
                 Traditional GEP-classifiers ignore the distribution of
                 samples, and hence decrease the efficiency and
                 accuracy. The contributions of this paper include: (1)
                 proposing two strategies of generating classification
                 threshold dynamically, (2) designing a new approach
                 called Distance Guided Evolution Algorithm (DGEA) to
                 improve the efficiency of GEP, and (3) demonstrating

                 threshold dynamically and DGEA by extensive
                 experiments. The results show that the new methods
                 decrease the number of evolutional generations by
                 83percent to 90percent, and increase the accuracy by

@article{Nunez:2006:msoec,
  abstract = {Evolutionary computation (EC) is a general term
                 applied to a group of global optimisation techniques
                 whose main characteristics are inspired by biological
                 evolution. Instead of working with one possible
                 solution at a time, they usually start with a
                 population of random solutions. The initial population
                 evolves into a better set of solutions through three
                 main processes: selection, recombination, and mutation.
                 Those solutions having greater fitness are
                 preferentially selected for recombination to produce a
                 new set of possible solutions. Mutation is also used to
                 maintain diversity within the newly created solutions.
                 Through these processes, the fittest solutions transfer
                 their characteristics to a new generation of solutions.
                 By iterating over many generations, EC can find
                 solutions to many complex problems.

                 Models and simulations, especially those working as a
                 federation, can serve as the fitness function to
                 determine the value or adequacy of particular
                 solutions. In such federations, genetic programming
                 (GP) or other EC techniques can quickly find optimal or
                 near-optimal solutions for particular problems or
                 situations. The user is not required to systematically
                 search for the optimal solution; the computer
                 accomplishes that task. The tradeoff for accepting this
                 advantage is the requirement for the use of high
                 performance computing resources.

                 In this paper we briefly describe the fundamental
                 characteristics of EC. We also show some of the results
                 obtained during our research and development efforts on
                 different problems like image noise reduction and
                 discrimination of buried unexploded ordnance. We also
                 provide examples of how EC can be used with models and
                 simulations to find optimum solutions to many
                 complicated problems. This technique has great
                 potential for use with models and simulations in a
                 federated environment. The modelling and simulation
                 community needs to become more aware of these powerful
                 EC techniques so they may be applied in a wide range of
                 fields to quickly provide solutions to the war
                 fighter.

                 Its first application to high energy physics data

                 used for event selection on samples with both low and

                 identification of selection rules that can be
                 interpreted as cuts applied on the input variables. The
                 signal/background classification accuracy was over

     applications from MP3 players, Hi-Fi systems, digital
     TVs, etc. to communication systems like wireless
     communication. They are implemented in DSPs and there
     are several trade-offs that make important to have an
     exact as possible estimation of the required filter
     order. In order to find a better estimation of the
     filter order than the existing ones, genetic expression
     programming (GEP) is used. GEP is a Genetic Algorithm
     that can be used in function finding. It is implemented
     in a commercial application which, after the
     appropriate input file and settings have been provided,
     performs the evolution of the individuals in the input
     file so that a good solution is found. The thesis is
     the first one in this new research line. The aim has
     been not only reaching the desired estimation but also
     pave the way for further investigations.",

     are presented based on an extensive database for
     centrifugal and mixed-flow compressors and pumps. The
     methodology of processing the data is briefly discussed
     here, and in more depth in a companion paper. In this
     investigation, the detailed steps of building the
     highly non-linear, multi-variable, coupled models are
     presented. This modelling includes the impeller, a
     vaneless diffuser, and/or a volute. In future papers,
     diverse classes of diffusers, guide vanes, and return
     channels will be added as well. Using genetic
     expression programming, models of very high order are
     developed. These models are then tested against neural
     network models that are built using the same database.
     Several different classes of performance models are
     built to meet global modeling requirements, specific
     discipline domain requirements, and to meet specific
     designers' requirements. This paper is one in a set of
     four papers. Papers No. 1 and 4 were presented at the
     ASME/IGTI Conference in Reno, Nevada, on June 6-9,
